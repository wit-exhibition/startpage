# Ada's Salon

Ada's Salon is a VR exhibition aiming to give visibility to women and non-binary people in computer science. Very often their contributions are overlooked or forgotten.

A group of students from the HTW Berlin build this exhibition to explore possibilities in VR and in-browser 3D to tell stories about the life, work, struggles and successes of these women and non-binary people.
